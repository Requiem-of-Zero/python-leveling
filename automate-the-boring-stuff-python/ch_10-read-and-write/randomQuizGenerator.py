We're a geography teacher with 35 students in our class and want to give a pop quiz
on US state capitals. Unfortunately, our class has a few bad eggs in it, and you can't
trust the students not to cheat. You'd like to randomize the order of questions so
that each quiz is unique, making it impossible for anyone to crib answers from anyone else

Requirements:

* Creates 35 different quizzes
* Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order
* Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each question, in random order
* Writes the quizzes to 35 text files
* Writes the answer keys to 35 text files
* Store the states and their capitals in a dictionary
* Call open(), write(), and close() for the quiz and answer key text files
* Use random.shuffle() to randomize the order of the questions and multiple-choice options
