'''
Requirements:

Create Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their
own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE, NOUN, ADVERB, or VERB appears in the text file.

Example text file:
The ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was
unaffected by these events.

The program would find these occurences and prompt the user to replace them

Example output text file:
The silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. A nearby
pickup truck was unaffected by these events.
